			<h2>2020 Democratic Candidates & Education </h2>


	<p> Education is a perennial issue on the campaign trail; candidates' stump speeches will generally make at least passing reference to the party orthodoxy on education policy. But how much do the potential 2020 candidates discuss education on a day-to-day basis? </p>

	<p> To answer this question, we downloaded recent Tweets by the leading Democratic 2020 hopefuls and analyzed how frequently they mentioned terms related to education. The results are below, followed by a more technical description of the methodology.</p>

	   <p>Our analysis considers the following potential candidates:</p>

	<p> The three governors appear to discuss education issues most frequently. This makes sense, as education in the United States is primarily administered at the state and local levels. This does not explain, however, why Mayors Bloomberg and Landrieu rank so low by this analysis; one would expect city-level officials to have a great deal to say about education. Although it does not replace a more in-depth look at candidates' platforms, this assessment of candidates' Tweet frequency may speak to their interest in education, so education-interested stakeholders should factor these data into their decisions about whom to support. </p>

	<p> We collected these data using the Python package Tweepy, which makes it possible to download recent Tweets by Twitter accounts. Generally, roughly the last three to four thousand Tweets are available by this method. Some candidates have multiple accounts, meaning that the number of Tweets collected for each candidated varied between roughly 1,500 (Biden) and nearly 7,500 (Booker). We then calculated what percentage of those Tweets included terms related to education (e.g. student, teacher, education, etc.).
