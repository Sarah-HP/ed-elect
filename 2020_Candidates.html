	<p>Education is a perennial issue on the campaign trail; candidates' stump speeches will generally make at least passing reference to the party orthodoxy on education policy. But how much do the potential 2020 candidates discuss education on a day-to-day basis? </p>

	<p>To answer this question, we downloaded recent tweets by the leading Democratic 2020 hopefuls and analyzed how frequently they mentioned terms related to education. The results are below, followed by a more technical description of the methodology.</p>

<h3 class="centerme textofchart">The governors tweet about education a lot, the mayors surprisingly little</h3>
	<div class="cand-chart" class = "iamachart" id="chart_sorted"></div>

<h4> Data Source: Tweets collected by the author, available <a href="https://github.com/Sarah-HP/ed-elect/tree/master/data">here.</a> Graphic adapted from: <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/Caged/6476579">bl.ocks.org</a></h4>

	
	<p> The three governors appear to discuss education issues most frequently. This makes sense, as education in the United States is primarily administered at the state and local levels. This does not explain, however, why Mayors Bloomberg and Landrieu rank so low by this analysis; one would expect city-level officials to have a great deal to say about education. Although it does not replace a more in-depth look at candidates' platforms--such as the one provided elsewhere on this site, this assessment of candidates' Tweet frequency may speak to their interest in education, so education-interested stakeholders should factor these data into their decisions about whom to support. </p>

	<p>A brief methodological note: recent candidate tweets were collected using Twitter's API, which allows for the download of roughly the past three thousand tweets per user. Since most candidates had multiple accounts, this generally produced a sample of several thousand statements (between 1,500 for Joe Biden and 7,500 for Cory Booker). Tweets were classified as "educational" by searching for education-related terms in the tweets' text. Education-related search terms included "teacher," "school," "college," "universities," the names of schools that have had recent school shooting, and trending education hashtags. This process was automated, and so there may be some misclassified tweets. Nevertheless, the chart above shows clear differences between some candidates that potentially correspond to the relative importance those candidates assign to education as a policy matter.</p>
