		<h2>Guns in Schools </h2>

<p> Violent school shootings have been the subject of headlines in recent years. In spite of these tragic events, the nation remains divided about which policies shouldbe enacted to end school shootings. </p>

<p> In 2017 the Pew Center found that the majority of surveyed Americans view the ease of legal access to guns as a factor that contributes "A great deal" or "A fair amount" to gun violence. </p>
