		<h2>Guns in Schools </h2>


<p> Violent school shootings have been the subject of headlines in recent years. In 2012 twenty children and six adults were killed during the devastating Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, which prompted a national conversation around gun violence. The New York Times reported 138 school shooting deaths from the time of Sandy Hook until 2018, and EdWeek maintains a <a href="https://www-edweek-org/ew/section/multimedia/school-shootings-this-year-how-many-and-where.html#about">school shooting tracker</a> that provides up-to-date information on recent episodes of violence.</p>

<p> Although gun violence is the second leading cause of child and teen death according to <a href="https://everytownresearch.org/gun-violence-america/#foot_note_22">Everytown</a>, a gun safety organization, the nation remains divided on the policies needed to curb gun violence in schools and in society.</p>

<p> In 2017 the Pew Center found that the majority of surveyed Americans view the ease of legal access to guns as a factor that contributes "A great deal" or "A fair amount" to gun violence. </p>

<p> In spite of the widespread sentiment that access to guns exacerbates issues of violent crime, gun reform remains a highly contentious issue, with groups like the NRA resisting proposed legislation. Such resistance complicates the task of policymakers and voters wishing to identify viable means of curbing gun violence. </p>
