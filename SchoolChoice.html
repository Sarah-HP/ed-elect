	<h2>School Choice</h2>

<p> School choice is the principle that families should be able to have agency in deciding where their children will attend school. The two most widely discussed types of school choice in the United States are vouchers and charter schools. </p>

<h3> The Buzz around Charters and Vouchers </h3>

<p> Charter schools are public schools with independent management. They are accountable for pursuing the goals established in the schools' charter. The <a href="https://credo.stanford.edu/pdfs/CMO%20FINAL.pdf">majority</a> (68%) of charter schools are operated independently (i.e. as a single school rather than a member of a network), with the remaining schools operating in various networks including "Charter Management Organizations" like the Knowledge is Power Program (KIPP) and Uncommon Schools. Sources of contention include whether charter schools <a href="https://www.educationnext.org/charter-schools-segregation-what-research-says/">fail to address issues of school segregation</a>, inflate their scores by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/06/opinion/sunday/how-successful-are-charter-schools.html">"skimming"</a> the best students or teaching to the standardized tests, if (and where) they outperform traditional public schools, and <a href="https://www.educationnext.org/charter-politics/">what explains the differences in states' charter laws</a>.</p>

<p> Vouchers are government funds that families can use toward the cost of private schools. Whereas advocates of vouchers approve of the increased choice afforded to families, criticism centers on the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/02/the-catholic-schools-saved-by-vouchers/516888/">use of vouchers at religious schools</a> and the <a href="effectivenesshttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/upshot/dismal-results-from-vouchers-surprise-researchers-as-devos-era-begins.html">effectiveness</a> of voucher programs.</p>

<h3> Charters and vouchers, increasingly, are a political reality.</h3>

<p>The nation's first charter school was <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-the-first-charter-school-in-america-city-academy-2015-6">founded in 1992</a>. By the 2015-2016 academic year, charter schools constituted a full 7% of the nation's public schools. The distribution of these schools is highly uneven. For example, 49.1% of the D.C. public schools and 24.2% of Arizona schools were charter schools. At the other end of the distribution are Alabama, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia, none of which had charter schools in the year under consideration.</p>

<p> Vouchers have a smaller market share. EdChoice, an organization that promotes school choice, reported in <a href="https://www.edchoice.org/school-choice/school-choice-in-america/#">June of 2018</a> that there were just over 190,000 students receiving vouchers nationwide.</p>

<h3> Democratic Party Largely Supportive of Charters; Republican Leaders Champion Multiple Forms of School Choice</h3>

<p> President Obama's "Race to the Top" program, which launched in 2009 and ultimately awarded more than <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/programs/racetothetop/index.html">$4 billion</a> of federal education funding to states, listed among the <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/programs/racetothetop/executive-summary.pdf">scoring and selection criteria </a> that states should not have laws against charter schools. President Trump's Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, has made school choice a central focus of her tenure.</p>

<p> During the 2016 election, the Democratic Party maintained a generally supportive stance toward non-profit charter schools, provided that they not undermine traditional public schools or underserve students of any particular demographic:</p>

	<blockquote> Democrats are committed to providing parents with high-quality public school options and expanding these options for low-income youth. We support democratically governed, great neighborhood public schools and high-quality public charter schools, and we will help them disseminate best practices to other school leaders and educators. Democrats oppose for-profit charter schools focused on making a profit off of public resources. We believe that high-quality public charter schools should provide options for parents, but should not replace or destabilize traditional public schools. Charter schools must reflect their communities, and thus must accept and retain proportionate numbers of students of color, students with disabilities and English Language Learners in relation to their neighborhood public schools. We support increased transparency and accountability for all charter schools. <h4>Source: <a href="https://democrats.org/about/party-platform/#free-college">DNC Platform, 2016</a>.</h4> </blockquote>

<p> The Republican Party, in contrast, has thrown its weight behind school vouchers under Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, an appointee of President Trump. The current administration's embrace of charter schools and school vouchers may drive away liberal supporters of school choice, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brown-center-chalkboard/2017/02/07/donald-trump-betsy-devos-and-the-changing-politics-of-charter-schools/">according to some pundits.</a> </p>

<h3> Political Parties Out of Step with Voter Base?</h3>

<p> A <a href="https://www.educationnext.org/files/2018ednextpoll.pdf">2018 poll</a> from Education Next asked respondents whether they "support or oppose the formation of charter schools" and if they would support a proposal "that would give low-income families with children in public schools a voucher" that could be used toward private schools. The results were surprising.</p>

<p>Opinions on school choice, it would seem, do not cleave fully to party lines. 44% of self-reported Republicans and Democrats alike expressed favorable opinions about the voucher programs for low-income families. There were, however, some observable differences in opinion when it came to charter schools. Whereas 57% of surveyed Republicans strongly or somewhat supported charter school, only 36% of Democrats expressed approval:</p>

<p> Democrats' support for charter schools has diminished somewhat since 2013. Data collected since 2015 shows that vouchers, in contrast, experienced a slight dip in popularity among Democrats before rebounding to 47% approval:</p>

<p> Minority groups appear to be more favorably disposed toward vouchers than toward charters, Hispanic respondents and non-Hispanic African Americans demonstrated slightly higher levels of support for voucher programs than for charter schools, a trend that was reversed among white respondents.</p>
