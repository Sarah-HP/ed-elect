		<h2>School Choice</h2>


	<p> The two most widely discussed types of school choice in the United States are vouchers and charter schools. The nation's first charter school was <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-the-first-charter-school-in-america-city-academy-2015-6">founded in 1992</a>. By the 2015-2016 academic year, charter schools constituted a full 7% of the nation's public schools. The distribution of these schools is highly uneven. For example, 49.1% of the D.C. public schools and 24.2% of Arizona schools were charter schools. At the other end of the distribution are Alabama, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia, none of which had charter schools in the year under consideration.</p>

	<p> Since the appointment of Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, vouchers as a form of school choice have taken on even greater salience. Questions of education will undoubtedly loom large in the 2020 presidential election.</p>

	<p> A recent poll of opinion data reveals that across parties, charter schools enjoy more popularity as a form of school choice than do vouchers. This is particularly true in the Republican Party, although Republican support for vouchers appears to have stagnated at around 40% </p>

	<p> Democrats exhibit a slightly different trend, with vouchers actually enjoying more popularity than charter schools. </p>

	<p> Notably, teachers (shown in the graph below in black and grey lines) are generally less supportive of alternatives to traditional public schools.</p>

	<p> The data looks somewhat different when examined at a more granular level. Michigan provides one example: </p>

		<p> In general, charter schools are less popular among voters who identify with the Democratic Party. Voters in the "Other" category (i.e. those who identify as independent, with a third party, who do not know, or who refused to provide their party affiliation), have a large amount of spread in their opinions. </p>
