<h2 id="background_info">Background Information on School Choice</h2>

<p> School choice is the idea that families should have a say in where their children attend school. The two most widely discussed types of school choice in the United States are vouchers and charter schools. </p>

<p> Charter schools are public schools that are managed separately from traditional public schools. They are accountable for pursuing the goals established in the schools' charter. The <a href="https://credo.stanford.edu/pdfs/CMO%20FINAL.pdf">majority</a> (68%) of charter schools are operated independently (i.e. as a single school rather than a member of a network), with the remaining schools operating in various networks including "Charter Management Organizations" like the Knowledge is Power Program (KIPP) and Uncommon Schools. Sources of contention include whether charter schools <a href="https://www.educationnext.org/charter-schools-segregation-what-research-says/">fail to address issues of school segregation</a>, inflate their scores by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/06/opinion/sunday/how-successful-are-charter-schools.html">"skimming"</a> the best students or teaching to the standardized tests, if (and where) they outperform traditional public schools, and <a href="https://www.educationnext.org/charter-politics/">what explains the differences in states' charter laws</a>.</p>

<p> Vouchers are government funds that families can use toward the cost of private schools. Whereas advocates of vouchers approve of the increased choice afforded to families, criticism centers on the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/02/the-catholic-schools-saved-by-vouchers/516888/">use of vouchers at religious schools</a> and the <a href="effectivenesshttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/upshot/dismal-results-from-vouchers-surprise-researchers-as-devos-era-begins.html">effectiveness</a> of voucher programs.</p>

<h3> Charters and Vouchers, Increasingly, Are a Political Reality.</h3>

<p>The nation's first charter school was <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-the-first-charter-school-in-america-city-academy-2015-6">founded in 1992</a>. By the 2015-2016 academic year, charter schools constituted a full 7% of the nation's public schools. The distribution of these schools is highly uneven. For example, 49.1% of the D.C. public schools and 24.2% of Arizona schools were charter schools. At the other end of the distribution are Alabama, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Vermont and West Virginia, none of which had charter schools in the year under consideration.</p>

        </div> 


<p> Vouchers have a smaller market share. EdChoice, an organization that promotes school choice, reported in <a href="https://www.edchoice.org/school-choice/school-choice-in-america/#">June of 2018</a> that there were just over 190,000 students receiving vouchers nationwide.</p>

<h3> Charter Schools Historically a Bipartisan Cause among Party Leaders</h3>

<p> President Trump's Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, has made school choice a central focus of her tenure. This--and the vocal charter school criticisms made by teachers' unions and left-leaning opponents of charter schools and vouchers--have given the impression that school choice is a squarely conservative cause. </p>

<p> Yet the charter school movement has antecedents in both parties. President Clinton advanced the then nascent charter school movement--so much so that the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools gave him a <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/hillary-clinton-charter-schools-education-215661">lifetime achievement award</a> in 2011. President Obama's educational reforms also encompassed charter schools. His signature "Race to the Top" program, which launched in 2009 and ultimately awarded more than <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/programs/racetothetop/index.html">$4 billion</a> of federal education funding to states, listed among the <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/programs/racetothetop/executive-summary.pdf">scoring and selection criteria </a> that states should not have laws against charter schools. </p>

<p> During the 2016 election, the Democratic Party maintained a cautiously supportive stance toward non-profit charter schools, provided that they not undermine traditional public schools or underserve students of any particular demographic groups:</p>

    <blockquote> Democrats are committed to providing parents with high-quality public school options and expanding these options for low-income youth. We support democratically governed, great neighborhood public schools and high-quality public charter schools, and we will help them disseminate best practices to other school leaders and educators. Democrats oppose for-profit charter schools focused on making a profit off of public resources. We believe that high-quality public charter schools should provide options for parents, but should not replace or destabilize traditional public schools. Charter schools must reflect their communities, and thus must accept and retain proportionate numbers of students of color, students with disabilities and English Language Learners in relation to their neighborhood public schools. We support increased transparency and accountability for all charter schools. <h4>Source: <a href="https://democrats.org/about/party-platform/#free-college">DNC Platform, 2016</a>.</h4> </blockquote>

<p> Notably, the 2016 party platform did not mention school vouchers.</p>

<h2 id="public_opinion">Public Opinion Mixed on School Choice</h2>

<h3> Partisan Divides in Public Support for Charter Schools, But Not for Vouchers</h3>

<p> A <a href="https://www.educationnext.org/files/2018ednextpoll.pdf">2018 survey</a> from Education Next asked respondents whether they "support or oppose the formation of charter schools" and if they would support a proposal "that would give low-income families with children in public schools a voucher" that could be used toward private schools.</p>

<p> Republican respondents were more supportive of charter schools than were Democrats:</p>

<h3 class="centerme textofchart">Republicans more favorable toward charter schools</h3> <h5 class="centerme texofchart">Percent of surveyed Republicans and Democrats who approve of charter schools (2018)</h5>

<img src="Images/partysupportcharter.JPG" class="centerImage"  alt="Support for charter schools by party" width=90%>
<h4> Source: <a href="https://www.educationnext.org/files/2018ednextpoll.pdf"
">Education Next, Program   on Education Policy and Governance -- Survey 2018</a>. Created in Excel</h4>

<p>Opinions did not cleave as neatly to party lines when it came to vouchers. Surprisingly, Democrat support for vouchers targeting low-income families was even higher than Republican support, at 39% and 47% respectively (Responses varried slightly based on the exact phrasing; see <a href="https://educationnext.org/files/ednext-poll-question-wording-over-time-through-2018.pdf">p.11</a> of the Education Next report). The trend flipped when Education Next asked about universal--as opposed to targeted--vouchers: A full 64% of Republicans but only 47% of Democrats said they would support universal--as opposed to targeted--vouchers (See <a href="https://educationnext.org/files/ednext-poll-question-wording-over-time-through-2018.pdf">p.10).</a> This suggests that Republican's responses are very sensitive to the wording of the question and that Republican support for vouchers is largely contingent on who would be eligible. </p>

<p> A more interesting difference in support for vouchers actually relates to ethnic groups. The majority of surveyed Hispanics and African Americans supported vouchers. Charter schools were slightly less popular among members of these demographic groups. Conversely, white respondents had a relative preference for charters over vouchers.</p>

<p> Democratic hopefuls may also be interested in gauging how the views of potential supporters have changed over time. The already tepid charter school support among Democratic voters seems to be trending downward slightly. Data collected on vouchers (starting in 2015) shows that vouchers, in contrast, experienced a slight dip in popularity among Democrats before rebounding to 47% approval:</p>

<p> Although opinion among surveyed Democrats has been relatively stable since 2013, public opinion may shift. The <a href="unexpectedly heatehttp://blogs.edweek.org.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/edweek/charterschoice/2016/11/massachusetts_charter_school_cap_decision.html">unexpectedly heated debate</a> in Massachusetts over a 2016 proposal to increase the charter cap, and the nationwide attention to Betsy DeVos' appointment to be Secretary of Education both show how quickly school choice can flare up as a headline-grabbing issue. The current administration's promotion of school vouchers and charter schools may also spark a realignment of the political landscape, according to commentators who <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brown-center-chalkboard/2017/02/07/donald-trump-betsy-devos-and-the-changing-politics-of-charter-schools/">anticipate</a> diminishing liberal support.</p>
