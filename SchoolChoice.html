	<h2>School Choice</h2>

<p> School choice is the principle that families should be able to have agency in deciding where their children will attend school. The two most widely discussed types of school choice in the United States are vouchers and charter schools. </p>

<h3> The Buzz around Charters and Vouchers </h3>

<p> Charter schools are public schools with independent management. They are accountable for pursuing the goals established in the schools' charter. The <a href="https://credo.stanford.edu/pdfs/CMO%20FINAL.pdf">majority</a> (68%) of charter schools are operated independently (i.e. as a single school rather than a member of a network), with the remaining schools operating in various networks including "Charter Management Organizations" like the Knowledge is Power Program (KIPP) and Uncommon Schools.</p>

<p> Sources of contention include whether charter schools <a href="https://www.educationnext.org/charter-schools-segregation-what-research-says/">fail to address issues of school segregation</a>, inflate their scores by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/06/opinion/sunday/how-successful-are-charter-schools.html">"skimming"</a> the best students or teaching to the standardized tests, if (and where) they outperform traditional public schools, and <a href="https://www.educationnext.org/charter-politics/">what explains the differences in states' charter laws</a>.</p>

<p> Vouchers are government funds that families can use toward the cost of private schools.</p>

<p> Whereas advocates of vouchers approve of the increased choice afforded to families, criticism centers on the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/02/the-catholic-schools-saved-by-vouchers/516888/">use of vouchers at religious schools</a> and the <a href="effectivenesshttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/upshot/dismal-results-from-vouchers-surprise-researchers-as-devos-era-begins.html">effectiveness</a> of voucher programs.</p>

<h3> Charters and vouchers, increasingly, are a political reality.</h3>

<p>The nation's first charter school was <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-the-first-charter-school-in-america-city-academy-2015-6">founded in 1992</a>. By the 2015-2016 academic year, charter schools constituted a full 7% of the nation's public schools. The distribution of these schools is highly uneven. For example, 49.1% of the D.C. public schools and 24.2% of Arizona schools were charter schools. At the other end of the distribution are Alabama, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia, none of which had charter schools in the year under consideration.</p>

<a>Vouchers have a smaller market share. EdChoice, an organization that promotes school choice, reported in <a href="https://www.edchoice.org/school-choice/school-choice-in-america/#">June of 2018</a> that there were just over 190,000 students receiving vouchers.</a>

    <p> Recent administrations have promoted charter schools. President Obama's "Race to the Top" program, which launched in 2009 and ultimately awarded more than <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/programs/racetothetop/index.html">$4 billion</a> of federal education funding to states, listed among the <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/programs/racetothetop/executive-summary.pdf">scoring and selection criteria </a> that states should not have laws against charter schools. President Trump's Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, has made school choice a central focus of her tenure.</p>

	<p> As of 2016, the Democratic National Committee expressed general support for charter schools, though the party platform criticized for-profit charters and addressed concerns that charter schools are underrepresenting minority students: </p>

	<blockquote> Democrats are committed to providing parents with high-quality public school options and expanding these options for low-income youth. We support democratically governed, great neighborhood public schools and high-quality public charter schools, and we will help them disseminate best practices to other school leaders and educators. Democrats oppose for-profit charter schools focused on making a profit off of public resources. We believe that high-quality public charter schools should provide options for parents, but should not replace or destabilize traditional public schools. Charter schools must reflect their communities, and thus must accept and retain proportionate numbers of students of color, students with disabilities and English Language Learners in relation to their neighborhood public schools. We support increased transparency and accountability for all charter schools. <h4>Source: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-the-first-charter-school-in-america-city-academy-2015-6https://democrats.org/about/party-platform/#free-college">DNC Platform, 2016</a>.</h4> </blockquote>

	<p> Since the appointment of Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, vouchers as a form of school choice have taken on even greater salience. Questions of education will undoubtedly loom large in the 2020 presidential election.</p>

<p> A 2018 poll from Education Next used the following questions to gauge the latest trends in public opinion.</p>

<ul>
    <p> 1. As you may know, many states permit the formation of charter schools, which are publicly funded but are not managed by the local school board.  These schools are expected to meet promised objectives, but are exempt from many state regulations. Do you support or oppose the formation of charter schools? </p>
    <p> 2. A proposal has been made that would give low-income families with children in public schools a voucher allowing them to enroll their children in attend[sic] private schools instea with government helping to pay the tuition. Would you support or oppose the proposal? </p>
</ul>

">Education Next, Program   on Education Policy and Governance -- Survey 2018 </a></h4>

<p> Support for charter schools and voucher programs was at 44% across all demographic groups. African American and Hispanic survey respondents demonstrated slightly higher levels of support for voucher programs than for charter schools, a trend that was reversed among white respondents.</p>

<p>Opinions on school choice do not cleave fully to party lines. 44% of self reported Republicans and Democrats alike expressing favorable opinions about the voucher programs for low-income families. The differences in opinion on charter schools were more pronounced along party lines:

<p> In general, charter schools are less popular among voters who identify with the Democratic Party. Voters in the "Other" category (i.e. those who identify as independent, with a third party, who do not know, or who refused to provide their party affiliation), have a large amount of spread in their opinions. </p>
