		<h2>School Choice</h2>

	<p> The two most widely discussed types of school choice in the United States are vouchers and charter schools. The nation's first charter school was <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-the-first-charter-school-in-america-city-academy-2015-6">founded in 1992</a>. By the 2015-2016 academic year, charter schools constituted a full 7% of the nation's public schools. The distribution of these schools is highly uneven. For example, 49.1% of the D.C. public schools and 24.2% of Arizona schools were charter schools. At the other end of the distribution are Alabama, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia, none of which had charter schools in the year under consideration.</p>

	<p> As of 2016, the Democratic National Committee expressed general support for charter schools, though the party platform criticized for-profit charters and addressed concerns that charter schools are underrepresenting minority students: </p>

	<blockquote> Democrats are committed to providing parents with high-quality public school options and expanding these options for low-income youth. We support democratically governed, great neighborhood public schools and high-quality public charter schools, and we will help them disseminate best practices to other school leaders and educators. Democrats oppose for-profit charter schools focused on making a profit off of public resources. We believe that high-quality public charter schools should provide options for parents, but should not replace or destabilize traditional public schools. Charter schools must reflect their communities, and thus must accept and retain proportionate numbers of students of color, students with disabilities and English Language Learners in relation to their neighborhood public schools. We support increased transparency and accountability for all charter schools. <h4>Source: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-the-first-charter-school-in-america-city-academy-2015-6https://democrats.org/about/party-platform/#free-college">DNC Platform, 2016</a>.</h4> </blockquote>

	<p> Since the appointment of Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, vouchers as a form of school choice have taken on even greater salience. Questions of education will undoubtedly loom large in the 2020 presidential election.</p>

	<p> A recent poll of opinion data reveals that across parties, charter schools enjoy more popularity as a form of school choice than do vouchers. This is particularly true in the Republican Party, although Republican support for vouchers appears to have stagnated at around 40% </p>

	<p> Democrats exhibit a slightly different trend, with vouchers actually enjoying more popularity than charter schools. </p>

	<p> Notably, teachers (shown in the graph below in black and grey lines) are generally less supportive of alternatives to traditional public schools.</p>

		<p> In general, charter schools are less popular among voters who identify with the Democratic Party. Voters in the "Other" category (i.e. those who identify as independent, with a third party, who do not know, or who refused to provide their party affiliation), have a large amount of spread in their opinions. </p>
