		<h2>Student Debt Crisis</h2>


    <p>  According to the major study conducted by Harvard Kennedy School, student debt is viewed as a major problem and financial considerations important factor for most prospective students when considering whether to pursue college and graduate degrees. If you are a student, researcher, donor, voter interested in finance and education statistics, the following student loan debt statistics can help you make more informed decisions in voting for potential presidental candidates in 2020 who support pro-student solution to this important societal problem. </p>

    <p> The total student debt in America was about $1.5 trillion in 2018. Student loan debt is now the second highest consumer debt category after only mortgage debt and higher than both credit cards and auto loans.According to the National Center for Education Statistics, there are more than 44 million borrowers who collectively owe $1.4 trillion in student loan debt in the U.S. The average student in the Class of 2016 has $37,172 in student loan debt.For students receiving bachelor’s degrees, the average debt load at graduation was $30,000 in 2017, which is based on data from the National Center for Education Statistics of the Federal Department of Education.</p>

    <h style = "color: green;"> Majority of College Students, 42% of All 18- to 29- Year Olds, Have Student Loan Debt </h>  

    <p>More than two-in-five (42%) Millennials between 18- and 29- years olds report that they, or someone in their household has student load debt; 48 percent indicated that they had no debt.  Unlike most questions in our survey, there was no statistical difference based upon age, gender or political party affiliation.Do you, or does someone in your household, currently have student loan debt?</p>  

    <h style = "color: green;">  7-in-10 Say That Financial Circumstances Played An Important Role in College Decision </h> 

    <p>Regardless of whether or not they have debt, 57 percent of Millennials under 30 believe that student debt is a major problem for young people in the United States -- and another 22 percent believe its a minor problem.  Overall, 79 percent say its a problem, four percent say it is not a problem.  
    In total, 70 percent of our sample reported that financial circumstances played an important (41% very, 29% somewhat)  role  in their decision whether or not to pursue a college education.</p> 
    
    <p style = "color: bold;">Those who were more likely to say that financial circumstances were important are:</p>
    <p>1.  Community college and two-year college students (87% say it played an important role compared to 70% college students); and</p>
    <p>2.  18- to 29- year old Blacks (52% say it played a very important role compared to 38% of Whites).
    When Millennials were asked who is most responsible for the rising amount of student debt in the U.S., 42 percent said colleges and universities, 30 percent the federal government -- students and state governments were held responsible by 11 and eight percent respectively.</p>


    <p> Below table shows that increases in average student loan debt at graduation have slowed, based on an analysis of recently released federal government data. However, borrowing has shifted from students to parents, especially at higher-cost colleges, because more students are reaching federal student loan limits.</p>

    <p> While student debt at graduation for bachelor’s degree recipients remains flat, Federal Parent PLUS loan debt continues to grow at an accelerating rate. The below table shows the long-term trend in cumulate increase of parental debt increased about $30,000 in 2011-12 to over $50,000, which is more than more than 20% increase.</p>

    <p> Trends in student loan debt for graduate school completers is not much different. Average loan balances for students who completed a research or professional doctorate increased between 1999–2000 and 2015–16 for all degree programs. Average loan balances approximately doubled for those who completed medical doctorates (from $124,700 to $246,000, an increase of 97 percent), Ph.D.’s outside the field of education (from $48,400 to $98,800, an increase of 104 percent), and other non‑Ph.D. doctorates (from $64,500 to $132,200, an increase of 105 percent). </p>

    <h3> States with the most student loan debt </h3>

    <p> Not surprisingly, states with larger populations have higher aggregate student loan debt. California, Florida, Texas and New York are among the four highest states for total student loan debt outstanding among resident borrowers.
    California, Florida, Texas and New York represent more than 20% of all U.S. student loan borrowers.</p>

     <h3>Social and Economic Implications of Student Debt </h3>

    <p>  According to Gallup polls, college graduates who carry a high amount of student debt appear to face long-term challenges that stretch beyond just their finances. A new analysis of Americans who graduated college between 1990 and 2014 shows that graduates who took on the highest amounts of student debt, $50,000 or more, are less likely than their fellow graduates who did not borrow for college to be thriving in four of five elements of well-being: purpose, financial, community, and physical.</p>

     <img src="Images/Gallupstudentdebt.png" alt="Gallupstudentdebt"width="700">

     <div>

     <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/174317/student-debt-linked-worse-health-less-wealth.aspx"> Source: Gallup </a>

     <p> Relatively recent college graduates -- those who earned their degree from 2000 to 2014 -- who have more than $50,000 in student debt are significantly less likely to be thriving financially and physically than their counterparts without loans. They are also less likely to have a strong sense of purpose and to be thriving in their community well-being. Notably, for 2000-2014 graduates, the most indebted degree holders are less likely to be thriving in social well-being. There are significant differences among these groups in the areas of financial and physical well-being. Higher debt signifies lower likelihood of thriving in these two areas of well-being. Graduates who went the deepest into debt to obtain their college degree, for instance, are far less likely to be thriving than graduates who took out no debt, by 15 percentage points in financial well-being and 10 points in physical well-being. The pattern is similar for graduates' sense of purpose, although those who borrowed over $50,000 are just as likely to be thriving in this element as those who borrowed $25,001 to $50,000. Graduates who took on the most debt for their degree are less likely to be thriving in this element than those who did not take out any loans for their undergraduate education.</p>

      <h> Position of Potential Presidental Candidates </h>

      <p> As the amount of money students are borrowing continues to grow, politicians and higher education leaders express concern that highly indebted graduates are unable to forge an economic identity after graduation, putting off major purchases and suffering from low savings. In 2010, the Obama administration reformed the student loan lending practice as a result of which private banks have been unable to administer federally backed student loans: the government now does all the lending. Republican’s position is to reverse this process and to stop the federal government handing out student loans, and want the private sector to take over.</p>

      <h> Republicans</h> 

      <p>As a result of the Obama administration reforms, borrowers could get student loans from the federal government or from private banks. When banks provided loans to students, the government would subsidize the banks to provide the loans. The 2016 Republican platform calls for the federal government to get out of the student loan business and stop providing loans to college students. Republicans believe the federal government should not provide any direct or indirect subsidy and that empowering the private-sector loan market will “give students access to a multitude of financing options” and drive down tuition costs by encouraging market competition.</p>

      <h> Democrats</h> 

      <p><a href="ttps://democrats.org/about/party-platform/#free-college">The 2016 Democratic Platform</a> shares the liberal belief that government can provide the solutions. The platform calls for “bold new investments by the federal government” to make “debt-free college a reality.” Democrats now advocate that families earning under an unspecified amount should not have to pay tuition for their child to attend public colleges or universities.
      The platform also seeks to relieve the burden of students who currently contend with “crushing student debt.” The Democrats say that, if elected, they will allow anyone with student debt to refinance their loans. In other words, if you received your loans at a time when interest rates were higher than they are today, you could refinance your loans and pay the lower rates.
      The platform also calls for lowering interest rates for future undergraduates, expanding access to income-based repayment, establishing a “student borrowers bill of rights” and allowing borrowers to discharge their student loan debts when they declare bankruptcy.</p>
