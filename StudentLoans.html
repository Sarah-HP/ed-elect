		<h2>Student Loans</h2>


	<p> The total student debt in America is about $1.4 trillion in 2018. Student loan debt is now the second highest consumer debt category after only mortgage debt and higher than both credit cards and auto loans. If you are a student, researcher, donor, voter interested in finance and education statistics, the following student loan debt statistics can help you make more informed decisions. </p>
    <p> According to the National Center for Education Statistics, there are more than 44 million borrowers who collectively owe $1.4 trillion in student loan debt in the U.S. The average student in the Class of 2016 has $37,172 in student loan debt.</p>
    <p> For students receiving bachelor’s degrees, the average debt load at graduation was $30,000 in 2017, which is based on data from the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study. The National Center for Education Statistics of the Federal Department of Education conducts the study every four years.</p>
    <p> Below table shows that increases in average student loan debt at graduation have slowed, based on an analysis of recently released federal government data. However, borrowing has shifted from students to parents, especially at higher-cost colleges, because more students are reaching federal student loan limits.</p>

    <p> Trends in student loan debt for graduate school completers is not much different. Average loan balances for students who completed a research or professional doctorate increased between 1999–2000 and 2015–16 for all degree programs for which data were available (in constant 2016–17 dollars). Average loan balances approximately doubled for those who completed medical doctorates (from $124,700 to $246,000, an increase of 97 percent), Ph.D.’s outside the field of education (from $48,400 to $98,800, an increase of 104 percent), and other non‑Ph.D. doctorates (from $64,500 to $132,200, an increase of 105 percent). </p>
