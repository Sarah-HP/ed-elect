<h2 id="background_info">Background on College Affordability</h2>


    <p>  According to the major study conducted by Harvard Kennedy School, student debt is viewed as a major problem and financial considerations important factor for most prospective students when considering whether to pursue college and graduate degrees. If you are a student, researcher, donor, voter interested in finance and education statistics, the following student loan debt statistics can help you make more informed decisions in voting for potential presidental candidates in 2020 who support pro-student solution to this important societal problem. </p>

    <p> The total student debt in America was about $1.5 trillion in 2018. Student loan debt is now the second highest consumer debt category after only mortgage debt and higher than both credit cards and auto loans.According to the National Center for Education Statistics, there are more than 44 million borrowers who collectively owe $1.4 trillion in student loan debt in the U.S. The average student in the Class of 2016 has $37,172 in student loan debt.For students receiving bachelor’s degrees, the average debt load at graduation was $30,000 in 2017, which is based on data from the National Center for Education Statistics of the Federal Department of Education.</p>

    <h style = "color: green;"> Majority of College Students, 42% of All 18- to 29- Year Olds, Have Student Loan Debt </h>  

    <p>More than two-in-five (42%) Millennials between 18- and 29- years olds report that they, or someone in their household has student load debt; 48 percent indicated that they had no debt.  Unlike most questions in our survey, there was no statistical difference based upon age, gender or political party affiliation.Do you, or does someone in your household, currently have student loan debt?</p>  

    <h style = "color: green;">  7-in-10 Say That Financial Circumstances Played An Important Role in College Decision </h> 

    <p>Regardless of whether or not they have debt, 57 percent of Millennials under 30 believe that student debt is a major problem for young people in the United States -- and another 22 percent believe its a minor problem.  Overall, 79 percent say its a problem, four percent say it is not a problem.  
    In total, 70 percent of our sample reported that financial circumstances played an important (41% very, 29% somewhat)  role  in their decision whether or not to pursue a college education.</p> 
    
    <p style = "color: bold;">Those who were more likely to say that financial circumstances were important are:</p>
    <p>1.  Community college and two-year college students (87% say it played an important role compared to 70% college students); and</p>
    <p>2.  18- to 29- year old Blacks (52% say it played a very important role compared to 38% of Whites).
    When Millennials were asked who is most responsible for the rising amount of student debt in the U.S., 42 percent said colleges and universities, 30 percent the federal government -- students and state governments were held responsible by 11 and eight percent respectively.</p>


    <p> Below table shows that increases in average student loan debt at graduation have slowed, based on an analysis of recently released federal government data. However, borrowing has shifted from students to parents, especially at higher-cost colleges, because more students are reaching federal student loan limits.</p>

    <p> While student debt at graduation for bachelor’s degree recipients remains flat, Federal Parent PLUS loan debt continues to grow at an accelerating rate. The below table shows the long-term trend in cumulate increase of parental debt increased about $30,000 in 2011-12 to over $50,000, which is more than more than 20% increase.</p>

    <p> Trends in student loan debt for graduate school completers is not much different. Average loan balances for students who completed a research or professional doctorate increased between 1999–2000 and 2015–16 for all degree programs. Average loan balances approximately doubled for those who completed medical doctorates (from $124,700 to $246,000, an increase of 97 percent), Ph.D.’s outside the field of education (from $48,400 to $98,800, an increase of 104 percent), and other non‑Ph.D. doctorates (from $64,500 to $132,200, an increase of 105 percent). </p>

    <h3> States with the most student loan debt </h3>

    <p> Not surprisingly, states with larger populations have higher aggregate student loan debt. California, Florida, Texas and New York are among the four highest states for total student loan debt outstanding among resident borrowers.
    California, Florida, Texas and New York represent more than 20% of all U.S. student loan borrowers.</p>

    <p> New Hampshire has the highest average student loan debt per student ($36,367) from the Class of 2016. </p>
    <p> Utah has the lowest average student loan debt per student ($19,975) from the Class of 2016.
    <p> As of 2018, more than 42 million student loan borrowers have student loan debt of $100,000 or less.</p>
    <p> More than 2 million student loan borrowers have student loan debt greater than $100,000, with 415,000 of that total holding student loan debt greater than $200,000.</p> 
    <p> The largest concentration of student loan debt is $10,000 - $25,000, which accounts for 12.4 million student loan borrowers.</p>

    <p> If you are a voter in a state with higher aggregate student loan debt, it is area where you can have an impact on policy change on this important social and educational issue.</p>

     <h3>Social and Economic Implications of Student Debt </h3>

    <p>  According to Gallup polls, college graduates who carry a high amount of student debt appear to face long-term challenges that stretch beyond just their finances. A new analysis of Americans who graduated college between 1990 and 2014 shows that graduates who took on the highest amounts of student debt, $50,000 or more, are less likely than their fellow graduates who did not borrow for college to be thriving in four of five elements of well-being: purpose, financial, community, and physical.</p>

     <img src="Images/Gallupstudentdebt.png" alt="Gallupstudentdebt"width="700">

     <div>

     <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/174317/student-debt-linked-worse-health-less-wealth.aspx"> Source: Gallup </a>

     <p> Relatively recent college graduates -- those who earned their degree from 2000 to 2014 -- who have more than $50,000 in student debt are significantly less likely to be thriving financially and physically than their counterparts without loans. They are also less likely to have a strong sense of purpose and to be thriving in their community well-being. Notably, for 2000-2014 graduates, the most indebted degree holders are less likely to be thriving in social well-being. There are significant differences among these groups in the areas of financial and physical well-being. Higher debt signifies lower likelihood of thriving in these two areas of well-being. Graduates who went the deepest into debt to obtain their college degree, for instance, are far less likely to be thriving than graduates who took out no debt, by 15 percentage points in financial well-being and 10 points in physical well-being. The pattern is similar for graduates' sense of purpose, although those who borrowed over $50,000 are just as likely to be thriving in this element as those who borrowed $25,001 to $50,000. Graduates who took on the most debt for their degree are less likely to be thriving in this element than those who did not take out any loans for their undergraduate education.</p>

     <h> Relevance for the 2020 Election </h>

     <p> Student debt is an increasingly pressing issue for voters. According to a survey conducted by the <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/10/22/more-in-u-s-see-drug-addiction-college-affordability-and-sexism-as-very-big-national-problems/">Pew Research Center</a> from September to October 2018, the percent of Americans who say that student debt is "a very big problem" in the country increased from 52% in 2016 to 63% in 2018. College affordability was more frequently cited  as a very big problem than were the gap between rich and poor, climate change, terrorism, gun violence, racism, sexism, and job opportunities. Only drug addiction, which 68% of Americans see as a problem, topped college affordability as a source of concern.</p>

      <h> Position of Potential Presidental Candidates </h>

      <p> As the amount of money students are borrowing continues to grow, politicians and higher education leaders express concern that highly indebted graduates are unable to forge an economic identity after graduation, putting off major purchases and suffering from low savings. In 2010, the Obama administration reformed the student loan lending practice as a result of which private banks have been unable to administer federally backed student loans: the government now does all the lending. Republican’s position is to reverse this process and to stop the federal government handing out student loans, and want the private sector to take over.</p>

      <h> Republicans</h> 

      <p>As a result of the Obama administration reforms, borrowers could get student loans from the federal government or from private banks. When banks provided loans to students, the government would subsidize the banks to provide the loans. The 2016 Republican platform calls for the federal government to get out of the student loan business and stop providing loans to college students. Republicans believe the federal government should not provide any direct or indirect subsidy and that empowering the private-sector loan market will “give students access to a multitude of financing options” and drive down tuition costs by encouraging market competition.</p>

      <h> Democrats</h> 

      <p><a href="ttps://democrats.org/about/party-platform/#free-college">The 2016 Democratic Platform</a> shares the liberal belief that government can provide the solutions. The platform calls for “bold new investments by the federal government” to make “debt-free college a reality.” Democrats now advocate that families earning under an unspecified amount should not have to pay tuition for their child to attend public colleges or universities.
      The platform also seeks to relieve the burden of students who currently contend with “crushing student debt.” The Democrats say that, if elected, they will allow anyone with student debt to refinance their loans. In other words, if you received your loans at a time when interest rates were higher than they are today, you could refinance your loans and pay the lower rates.
      The platform also calls for lowering interest rates for future undergraduates, expanding access to income-based repayment, establishing a “student borrowers bill of rights” and allowing borrowers to discharge their student loan debts when they declare bankruptcy.</p>

<h3 class="centerme textofchart">Men and Women Have Similarly Mixed Feelings about Free College, but Support Drops with Age</h3>

<div id="opinion_1" class="centerme"></div>



<h2 id="candidate_positions">2020 Candidate Positions on College Affordability</h2>

<p>The 2016 Democratic Party Platform made major promises regarding free community college, debt-free public universities, and student loan borrower protections:

<blockquote>Democrats believe that in America, if you want a higher education, you should always be able to get one: money should never stand in the way. Cost should not be a barrier to getting a degree or credential, and debt should not hold you back after you graduate. Bold new investments by the federal government, coupled with states reinvesting in higher education and colleges holding the line on costs, will ensure that Americans of all backgrounds will be prepared for the jobs and economy of the future. Democrats are unified in their strong belief that every student should be able to go to college debt-free, and working families should not have to pay any tuition to go to public colleges and universities.
  <br>
  <br>
  We will also make community college free, while ensuring the strength of our Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority-Serving Institutions. The federal government will push more colleges and universities to take quantifiable, affirmative steps in increasing the percentages of racial and ethnic minority, low-income, and first-generation students they enroll and graduate. Achieving these goals depends on state and federal investment in both students and their teachers. Whether full-time or adjunct, faculty must be supported to make transformative educational experiences possible.
<br>
<br>
As we make college affordable for future students, we will not forget about the millions of borrowers with unsustainable levels of student debt, who need help right now. Democrats will allow those who currently have student debt to refinance their loans at the lowest rates possible. We will simplify and expand access to income-based repayment so that no student loan borrowers ever have to pay more than they can afford. And we will significantly cut interest rates for future undergraduates because we believe that making college more affordable is more important than the federal government making billions of dollars in profit off those loans. Democrats will also fight for a student borrower bill of rights to ensure borrowers get adequate information about options to avoid or get out of delinquency or default. We will hold lenders and loan servicers to high standards to help borrowers in default rehabilitate and repay their debts. We will continue the important Public Service Loan Forgiveness and loan discharge programs begun by the Obama Administration. Finally, Democrats will restore the prior standard in bankruptcy law to allow borrowers with student loans to be able to discharge their debts in bankruptcy as a measure of last resort. To make progress toward these goals, the government should offer a moratorium on student loan payments to all federal loan borrowers so they have the time and get the resources they need to consolidate their loans, enroll in income-based repayment programs, and take advantage of opportunities to reduce monthly payments and fees.<h4>Source: <a href="https://democrats.org/about/party-platform">DNC Platform, 2016</a>.</h4> </blockquote>

<p>To what degree have potential 2020 candidates embraced this focus on college affordability? To find out, we first analyzed the frequency with which 2020 hopefuls tweeted about college affordability issues. We then summarized each candidate's position on the matter. The results are below.</p>




<h3 class="centerme textofchart">The Progressives Tweet about College a Lot; Other Candidates' Interest Levels Vary</h3>

<div class="cand-chart" id="cand_aff_pct_tweet"></div>

<p>As the chart above shows, there is wide variation in the frequency with which potential Democratic 2020 candidates tweet about college affordability, relative to other education issues. Based on this, one can reasonably infer that college affordability will be a more central issue in a potential Sanders campaign than it is proving to be in the Ojeda campaign. More generally, it seems that the issue is more important to the party's progressive wing, headlined by Sanders and Warren, than to other subgroups.</p>


<p>The graph, however, gives only a very high-level summary of candidate priorities and no information on the details of their proposals. To see more specifically what each candidate has been saying about the issue of college affordability, click on the candidate's name below to see the candidate's recent tweets on the subject and an overview of their message. Note that the tweets were selected automatically by searching for tweets that include terms related to college affordability and, unless otherwise noted, those selections have not been manually altered.
