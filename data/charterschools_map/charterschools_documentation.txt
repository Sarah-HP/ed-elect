To create the graphic:

1) Took the data saved as "tabn216.90xls"

2) Manually removed the "...." after each state name (example: "Alabama ...................." became "Alabama")

3) Pasted the contents of column O into datawrapper's chloroplath map of the U.S. (available here: https://app.datawrapper.de/map/6FRcb/data)

4) This yielded a graphic with an embed code, which I pasted into the relevant part of our website.
