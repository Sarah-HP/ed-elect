This is the display of tweets at the bottom of the college affordability page. The "data" it intakes is a list of tweet IDs. To generate this, I used the python script t_filter.py (the copy I used was in the scraping folder; there is now one in the scripts folder as well), followed by t_id_generator.py (again, in the scraping folder at the time, now with a copy both there and in the scripts folder). I then took the output of this file and put it into a file with the command line: python3 t_id_generator.py > recent_aff_college_tweet_ids.txt (this file is in the scraping folder, where I was when I originally ran this code). I then copy/pasted this text into the list of tweet ids in the javascript file for the tweet display, display_aff_tweets.js. I manually added one older tweet from Ojeda that I found while researching his positions (too old to be in the tweets the API let us access through Tweepy). For transparency, I made a note of this with the display on the webpage.

See the js file for comments on how it works.
