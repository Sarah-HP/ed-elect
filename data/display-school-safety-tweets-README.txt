This is the display of tweets at the bottom of the college affordability page. The "data" it intakes is a list of tweet IDs. To generate this, I used the python script safety_filter.py (the copy I used was in the scraping folder; there is now one in the scripts folder as well), followed by safety_id_generator.py (again, in the scraping folder at the time, now with a copy both there and in the scripts folder). I then took the output of this file and put it into a file with the command line: python3 safety_id_generator.py > recent_safety_tweet_ids.txt (this file is in the scraping folder, where I was when I originally ran this code). I then copy/pasted this text into the list of tweet ids in the javascript file for the tweet display, display_ss_tweets.js.

See the js file for comments on how it works.
