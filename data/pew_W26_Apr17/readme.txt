// This is the documentation for a graph on the school violence page entitled "Americans in the Northeast are most likely to see ease of legal access to guns as a contributor to gun violence, but the rest of the country isn't far behind"

Here were my steps:

0. Ported the data from .sav to a stat-compatible format to facilitate analysis

1. I conducted the initial data analysis in Stata (see "ExploratoryDataAnalysis/Pew Data Visualization.do" for a heavily annotated description of my process)

2. In line 58 I made a graphic showing fears about gun violence by region

3. I then decided to challenge myself and remake the graphic in d3

4. Please refer to scripts/gunsandschools.js for more detail
