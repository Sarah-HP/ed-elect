Data transformation steps for the "Education Next" data displayed under the title "Republicans more favorable toward charter schools" and "Support for school choice is mixed overall, though majority of Hispanic and Black respondents favor vouchers"

// FOR THE CHARTS TRANSFORMED IN EXCEL AND DISPLAYED ON THE "SCHOOL CHOICE" PAGE AS "REPUBLICANS MORE FAVORABLE TOWARD CHARTER SCHOOLS" AND "SUPPORT FOR SCHOOL CHOICE IS MIXED OVERALL"

1. This excel spreadsheet was generated by manually entering (and visualizing) data from https://www.educationnext.org/files/2018ednextpoll.pdf and from https://educationnext.org/files/ednext-poll-question-wording-over-time-through-2018.pdf

2. On each sheet of the excel spreadsheet, I kept notes on the EdNEXT sources from which I took information. The data was available in PDF format, so I manually entered the data into tables. 

[The green and blue graph data comes from:Source of Data: Education Next, Program on Education Policy and Governance -- Survey 2018, Tables 13a and 15d.]

[The data for the red and blue graph came from https://www.educationnext.org/files/2018ednextpoll.pdf. I took data from the final two columns of chart 13a. Note that I reordered the data slightly by putting "Neither support nor oppose" in the middle (as opposed to at the end) of the graphic I made.

3. Interested in the graphics themselves? If you double click on the graphcs within the excel file in this folder, you can see how the data were configured/


// FOR THE D3

I manually entered charter school popularity by year into a list of dictionaries. Further details on the data transformations are available in the d3 code annotations (also on the school choice page)
