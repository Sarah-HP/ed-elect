Data transformation steps:

// FOR THE CHARTS TRANSFORMED IN EXCEL AND DISPLAYED ON THE "SCHOOL CHOICE" PAGE AS "REPUBLICANS MORE FAVORABLE TOWARD CHARTER SCHOOLS" AND "SUPPORT FOR SCHOOL CHOICE IS MIXED OVERALL"

1. This excel spreadsheet was generated by manually entering (and visualizing) data from https://www.educationnext.org/files/2018ednextpoll.pdf and from https://educationnext.org/files/ednext-poll-question-wording-over-time-through-2018.pdf

2. On each SHEET of the excel spreadsheet, I kept notes on the EdNEXT sources from which I took information. The data was available in PDF format, so I manually entered the data into tables. 

3. If you double click on the excel graphs, you can see the data that went into them/


// FOR THE D3

I manually entered charter school popularity by year into a list of dictionaries. Further details on the data transformations are available in the d3 code annotations (also on the school choice page)
