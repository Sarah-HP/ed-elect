            <h2>About</h2>


            <p> This site aims to provide a one-stop electoral primer on education issues for for both potential 2020 Democratic candidates and Democratic voters.</p>

            <p>Voters will likely want to begin by reviewing the 2020 Candidates page, which provides an overview of possible candidates and an assessment of their engagement with education issues in their public comments, based on a review of recent activity on their Twitter pages. Candidates may also be interested in this page for the purposes of opposition research.</p>

            <p>The remainder of the site is divided into pages based on individual issues within education policy—school choice, school safety, and college affordability and student loans. Each page provides a primer on current public opinion to inform candidates’ policy stances and information on potential candidates’ past positions on the issue to help voters decide whom to support. </p>
