The code for the file rr.sh, which passes a file line by line to the command line, came from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10929453/read-a-file-line-by-line-assigning-the-value-to-a-variable/. I used that code to hit each Twitter account in twitters.csv (which isn't actually a CSV; I discovered after making it that my function worked better with the data in a different format) with the scraper.
